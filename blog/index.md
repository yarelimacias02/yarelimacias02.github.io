Okay time to get serious 
> Yesterday I had learned more of the basic skills like opening files, moving directories and even to see ciphers. 

> Today I leanred how to decode Gzip, Bzip2, Tar, and base64. We do this by chaging the ending of the files and and opening them and seeing what they contain. Overall it was a tedious process but it was satisfing to finally solve it anf ifnd the solution. 

> I even learned new languages in coding and even skills such ass getting shortcuts through the program Terminal. For example like Tab inorder to to type everything and the up arrow to see past commands that I had typed.
